Orcas Tug Boat Testing
Goal: make it work
Day 1:
•	We plugged in any lose wires, then changed the port for the servo to read as “5” in the computer. With this, the test code for servos was able to work. So the flappy things on the back work.
•	We tried to make the propellers work but were unsuccessful. Need to research the motor that the propellers are connected to, it is unfamiliar.
