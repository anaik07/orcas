# What We Do
ORCAS is working as part of the [Olin Robotics Lab](http://olinrobotics.github.io) to create a fleet of autonomous underwater vehicles capable of navigation, obstacle detection and avoidance, and carrying out various types of missions. All of the platforms will use the same hardware, ensuring ease of operation and use, as well as the ability to choose a platform based on its suitability to a certain project rather than it's compatibility with hardware and software. The vehicles will be customizable platforms capable of carrying various payloads for a wide array of possible missions.
