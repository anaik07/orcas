### Olin Robotic Collaborative Autonomous Submersibles (ORCAS)
ORCAS is an undergraduate research team within the Olin Robotics Lab working on
designing, manufacturing, and maintaining a fleet of autonomous submersible
platforms for use in a variety of applications. We aim to give all of our
platforms autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance, as well as more mission-
specific capabilities and hardware dependent on current lab projects. Another
goal is to create collaboration ability between submersibles and, possibly,
between a submersible and another class of vehicle (land, air, etc) to allow
greater customization of robotic tools per mission. Some students are gaining
skills through this research to enable them to compete in the RoboSub
Competition.
